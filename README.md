# Rescueland

Recua, aka Rescueland, is part of the multiverse, as few people know it. Its location cannot be fathomed by common earthlings, as it is located beyond the borders of the known universe, from which conventional technology on planet earth only senses the background radiation.
The name 'Rescueland' formed in the process of Recua 'rescuing' civilisations against a phletora of enemies dotted around the multiverses. The name has stuck ever since. 
To give an illustration of space scale: If the earth-known universe corresponds to the content of a tea cup, the earth would be a single electron, and Rescueland corresponds to the cup containing our known world. Rescueland existed since when the cup was filled, i.e., the event commonly known as the Big Bang.

Rescueland existence begins: 5,630,630 r.ly (Rescueland years) BDOTR (Before the Discovery of the Rings), which is exactly when the Big Bang happened.
Rescueland has evolved for 500,000 earth years anno domini, coming up with technology nobody on earth in 2024 AD would remotely think of being possible. 

Computerland, in the analogon of the tea cup model, is another cup-sized system, so far away that even the longest-range ships find it impractical to travel between Rescueland and Computerland regularly. In this scale, imagine the distance between the Computerland and Rescueland cups corresponding to the distance between Spain and New Caledonia.

These are the notes and data about Rescueland and Computerland, including the technology, the history, the planets and the types of ships used.
Facts and concepts are interdependent to a very high degree. Hence, for a complete understanding, it is likely required to double parse these documents.


[The Technology of Rescueland, Computerland and it's surrounding Planets](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland_books/blob/main/The%20Technology%20of%20Rescueland%2C%20Computerland%20and%20it's%20surrounding%20Planets.md)
is far superior to the technology on planet earth in century 21.
Through millenia of basic research, it became possible to control all aspects of matter on every scale, resulting in interesting quecto-materials aggregated into macroscopic hyperstructures. 
A detailed reference of all technological minutiae is beyond the scope of this script, as no single person or Non-Rescueland robot has sufficient mental capacity or storage to retain it. A coarse overview is sufficiently taxing.

[The Timeline of Rescueland History](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md)
reaches back to the Big Bang, including the major events DOTR, the start of the space-age, beginning of intra-multiversal travel, discovery of Bad Guy Land and Computerland, introduction of the Super Twos and the succession of major multiversal conflicts.

[The Planet File](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Planet%20File.md)
holds key data on major planets in and around the Rescueland Empire, notably popuation, atmospheric conditions, emblems, geography, military capabilities, political system, multiversal status and general information.

[The Ship File](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Ship%20File.md)
reveals the design basics of all major vehicles patrolling the multiverse.
