# Rescueland

Rescueland, a.k.a. Recua, is part of the multiverse, as few people know it. Its location cannot be fathomed by common earthlings, as it is located beyond the borders of the known universe. To give an illustration of scale: If earth-known universe corresponds to the content of a tea cup, the earth would be a single electron, and Rescueland corresponds to the cup containing our known world. Rescueland existed before the the cup was filled, after the event commonly known as big bang.
Computerland, in the analogon of the tea cup model, is another cup-sized system, so far away that even the longest-range ships find it impractical to travel between Rescueland and Computerland. In this scale, imagine the distance between the Computerland and Rescueland cup corresponding the distance between Spain and New Caledonia.

These are the notes and data about Rescueland and Computerland, including the technology, the history and the planets.
