To address these issues, military strategists called for a comprehensive overhaul focusing on categorization, efficiency, and specialization.

### New Ship Classes

During the Revolution, three new primary classes of ships were introduced: Interceptors, Battleships, and Pocket Destroyers. They were designed to be effective, while still being cheap to build. They would now have default weaponry and engines, to be factorised rather than being build individualy.

1. Interceptors: 
   - Role: Designed for speed and agility, interceptors serve as the primary vessels for fleet defense and offensive tactics. They engage in hit-and-run attacks and protect larger ships from incoming threats.
   - Specifications: Lightly armored but equipped with advanced shields and weaponry, interceptors swarm enemy forces with precision attacks.
   - Fleet Deployment: Floated in large formations around larger ships, interceptors serve to establish a protective barrier while conducting reconnaissance.

2. Battleships: 
   - Role: Heavy hitters of the Rescueland fleet, battleships carry massive weaponry, intended to deliver overwhelming firepower against enemy installations and fleet formations. They also cary smaller ships to battle.
   - Specifications: With thick armor plating and integrated FFG technology, battleships mount long-range missile systems, massive slit bombs and energy beam generators, enabling them to engage enemies from a distance with deadly accuracy.
   - Fleet Deployment: Battleships become the core of Rescueland’s fleet, leading fleets into battle and providing formidable fire support to smaller vessels. Each battleship commands smaller groups of interceptors and pocket destroyers for coordinated assaults.

3. Pocket Destroyers: 
   - Role: These versatile mid-sized vessels fill the gap between interceptors and battleships. They boast a balance of speed, mobility, and firepower, able to engage both smaller craft and larger ships.
   - Specifications: Pocket Destroyers feature the same weaponry as battleships, but have enhanced maneuverability and a larger crew capacity for boarding actions when necessary.
   - Fleet Deployment: Pocket Destroyers flank battleships in formation and act as support for interceptors, offering adaptive strategies depending on battlefield conditions.

### The Impact on Rescueland’s Military

By 107 ADOTR, the Rescueland military had successfully integrated the new classes and organized its fleets, establishing a resilient and adaptable force prepared for any challenges.

- Increased Combat Efficiency: The newly organized army enhances coordination across all levels of the military hierarchy, resulting in improved battle tactics. Joint operations enable precise execution of strategies, reducing casualties and maximizing effectiveness.

- Technological Advancements: Continued investment in R&D further refines each ship class's capabilities. Upgrades to weapons systems, shields, and AI technology ensure the Rescueland military remains at the forefront of galactic warfare.

- Deterrence Against Future Threats: The restructured military creates a formidable deterrent, dissuading potential aggressors from challenging Rescueland’s influence. The successful revolution establishes confidence within the Empire, fostering unity and purpose among its forces.

The success of the revolution of the armies fundamentally alters the course of Rescueland’s military history. With the introduction of Interceptors, Battleships, and Pocket Destroyers, alongside a commitment to organizational excellence, the Empire stands fortified against any future threats. The revolution marks a new era of military prowess, poised to defend the Empire's interests across the galaxy and maintain peace and order in an ever-evolving universe.

## 105 - 508 ADOTR: The Golden Age

Mega*9 Ultra*9 Bad Guy Land's destruction struck fear into any other resistance, and the Rescueland Empire experienced a very long era of peace, alowing technology to advance massively.

## 508 ADOTR: War against Horsa

In 508 ADOTR, the Rescueland Empire faced a formidable threat from the planet Horsa, which had also advanced its military technology and fielded a newly constructed fleet. With a well-organized and powerful military, Horsa posed an immediate danger to Rescueland’s territorial integrity. Drawing upon their recently restructured military, the Rescueland Empire prepared for an intense confrontation that would shape the future of both civilizations.

Horsa, a planet known for its resource-rich environments and strategic positioning within the galaxy, had empowered its military significantly in recent years. With the ambition to expand its influence, the Horsa military under the command of General Kael developed advanced warships and refined tactics that could potentially rival the Rescueland Space Force.
Rescueland's intelligence had detected unusual military movements from Horsa, prompting military strategists, including Commander of War, Nuchie, to assume a posture of readiness. With a fleet numbering a few hundred thousand ships —an impressive size but still dwarfed by the scales possible in the galaxy — the Rescueland military prepared for potential engagement.

As relations deteriorated, skirmishes broke out near Horsa’s outer rim. In the early months of 508 ADOTR, two fleets collided in what would become one of the first significant space battles of the war.
The Rescueland fleet, organized into a cohesive task force of Interceptors, Battleships, and Pocket Destroyers, advanced towards Horsa’s territory. Nuchie led the fleet from the bridge of the flagship, the Perigrine, a class-A Battleship.

The first engagement involved a clash between Rescueland Interceptors and Horsa Interceptors. Agile maneuvers and precise targeting software allowed Rescueland’s small but advanced interceptor squadrons to hold their ground against Horsa’s opponents.
As Rescueland’s Interceptors engaged the Horsa Interceptors, General Kael unleashed the Titan-Class Battleships. Their heavy artillery unleashed a torrent of firepower against Rescueland’s formations. The Battleships took hits but maintained strong defensive formations, soaking damage for evasive Pocket Destroyers to flank enemy vessels.
As the war progressed, both sides demonstrated their adaptability, each employing innovative strategies to maximize the strengths of their ship classes.
Utilizing the high-speed capabilities of Rescueland Interceptors, Commander of War Nuchie ordered them to engage in aggressive flanking maneuvers. They used the nebula clouds surrounding Horsa as cover to launch surprise strikes against the Titan-Class vessels, drawing fire away from the Battleships.
A squadron of Rescueland Pocket Destroyers was dispatched to shield the Battleships from the encroaching Torpedo Cruisers. Skillful piloting and the effective use of FFG technology allowed these ships to intercept numerous torpedoes, shockingly altering their trajectories and rendering them ineffective against the capital ships.
As Horsa's forces began to regroup, Rescueland’s Battleships initiated a coordinated broadside attack using their long-range missile systems. A combination of timed strikes made possible through integrated targeting systems allowed them to severely damage the leading Titan-Class battleships, tipping the scales of the war.

A decisive engagement occurred above Horsa's capital city, as both fleets converged for a final stand.
With winning momentum, the Rescueland fleet accelerated its assault, launching waves of Interceptors that overwhelmed Horsa’s defensive lines. A full-throttle strike from Pocket Destroyers followed, smashing into the flanks of Horsa’s formation.
After hours of fierce conflict, the Horsa Titan-Class Battleships, having sustained heavy losses, struggled to maintain formation. Miscommunication within their ranks led to vulnerabilities which Rescueland capitalized on, ruthlessly taking down ship after ship.
In a final desperate bid, General Kael attempted to retreat within the last standing Titan-Class Battleship. However, forces coordinated through Nuchie’s unified command system intercepted them, leading to his capture and averting further escalation of the conflict.

The war against Horsa ended with another victory for the Rescueland Empire. The organization and efficiency demonstrated in the battle underscored the success of the recent military reforms.
With the capture of General Kael and the devastation of its fleet, Horsa was forced into submission. Rescueland negotiators entered discussions to guarantee peace and prevent further militaristic ambitions from Horsa.

## 510 ADOTR: The War Against Federre

In the wake of the victory over Horsa, the Rescueland Empire enjoyed another brief period of stability; however, this tranquility was soon interrupted by the emergence of Federre, a planet from a nearby galaxy equipped with equally advanced technologies and ambitions similar to those of Horsa. The rulers of Federre were determined to assert their dominance over the region, setting the stage for yet another high-tech conflict.
Initially, Weda underestimated the military capabilities of Federre, believing their advances in technology and military restructuring would afford them another easy victory. Federre’s military included fleets outfitted with advanced cloaking technology, modern weaponry designed to bypass most defenses, and their elite Eagle Fighters — considered some of the most formidable ships in the galaxy. Their forces outnumbered Rescueland's at the outset, comprising over a million technologically enhanced ships.
As tensions escalated, a series of skirmishes erupted near strategic trade routes. Utilizing covert operations, Federre forces, ambushed Rescueland supply lines, leading to significant logistical disruptions. Caught off-guard, Rescueland suffered heavy losses in these early engagements, and their initial counter-attacks were met with overwhelming force.
The situation became dire when Federre launched a surprise offensive against the Rescueland flagship, the Perigrine, during an attempt at negotiation. The Federre fleet, led by agile Eagle Fighters, compromised the Rescueland fleet’s defenses before destroying critical support vessels, forcing Rescueland forces into a defensive position with several ships captured or destroyed in the chaos.
Recognizing the threat Federre posed, Weda re-evaluated their strategy. They focused on reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering to fully understand Federre’s newfound tactics and technological advancements. The development of specialized countermeasures became paramount, leading to the creation of new technology explicitly designed to counter cloaking technologies and the threat posed by the Eagle Fighters.
With these new devices, Rescueland engineers developed a sensor array capable of detecting Federre vessels during their invisibility phases. Simultaneously, they began retrofitting older ships with improved weapon systems, replacing Solitme slit bombs with Techanda.
With adequate reinforcements and major strategic upgrades in technology, Rescueland finally prepared for a large-scale counteroffensive. Spurred by a renewed sense of determination, the Rescueland forces launched an assault aimed at key Federre strongholds, culminating in an all-or-nothing battle above the planet.
As Rescueland forces approached Federre’s defenses, they deployed the new sensor arrays, allowing their ships to detect incoming enemy vessels despite their cloaking technology. Recognizing that surprise had proven vital to Federre's previous victories, Rescueland commanders took strategic positions and scrambled their forces.
In the pivotal battle over Federre, Rescueland interspersed their fleets, including specialized units to counter the Eagle Fighters, employing advanced weaponry in a harmonious concert. With coordinated assaults and improved communication, they established formations designed to outmaneuver Federre's tactics.
Federre, ironicaly underestimating the intelligence advancements of Rescueland, found its forces in disarray as they faced waves of Rescueland ships reinforced with rapid-response squadrons. The Rescueland fleet engaged in aerial dogfights, utilizing superior speed and quality to cripple Federre formations.
As the battle intensified, Rescueland deployed Hydro-Bombs to finish off most of the remaining fighters, further causing chaos among Federre ranks. 
Finally, in a coordinated strike, specialized ships deployed FFG to absorb incoming projectiles while breaching the heavily fortified Federre command ship. Forcing their way onto the flagship led to a brutal ground engagement; Rescueland forces claimed victory over the planet and dismantled Federre's hierarchical control.
