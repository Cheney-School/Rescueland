[Computerland](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Planet%20File.md#computerland-i) is an extraordinary planet composed of a Conductium core and sentient electricity, characterized by its unique technological advancement and cooperative relations with the Rescueland Empire. However, it's history is relatively uneventful compared to that of [Rescueland](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md). This timeline highlights the significant events that shaped Computerland since its establishment and its evolution as a close ally of Rescueland.

## 5630630 BDOTR: The creation of Computerland

Computerland formed roughly the same time as Rescueland, this is not a coinsident as the very natue of the creation of comuterland would not be allowed in this state of the universe. The Sentient electricity is not sentient at this point, as the reason it is sentient is still a mystery but it seems to learn and evolve like life, but without having to die to make changes.

## 3653454 BTOTR: The evolution of sentience

This time is were the sentient electricity of computerland gained it's setience. At this point the hive minded nature of the elecricity was divided into multiple individuals, but still with the optiojn to be a part of the hive mind to donate knowledge, communicate, and learn.

## 2950670 BROTR: The understanding of science

At this time the beings of computerland learnt the nature of the universe, whitch in turn boosted the number of scientific revolution significanty now that they knew the laws that the unverse followed.

## 0134233 BDOTR: Discovery of the multiverse

Although they did not have the power to break the barrier at this moment, But they knew that there time would come.

## 14 ADOTR: Discovery of Rescueland

In an important moment for intergalactic relationships, Computerland discovered Rescueland during its early space explorations. The people of Computerland learned about Rescuelandâ€™s fight against the tyrants of Bad Guy Land and recognized their shared objective of resisting oppression. This key first contact set the stage for a strong alliance, uniting them to pool their strengths and collaborate cohesively against their mutual adversary.

## 15 ADOTR: The breach of the universal boarded

After successful allience with Rescueland they manage to learn and borrow some tech from them to travel between univesres. This allowed Computerland to see the full threat of Bad guy land, whitch they had only known from scout ship in their univesre.
