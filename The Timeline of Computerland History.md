[Computerland](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Planet%20File.md#computerland-i) is an extraordinary planet composed of a Conductium core and sentient electricity, characterized by its unique technological advancement and cooperative relations with the Rescueland Empire. However, it's history is relatively uneventful compared to that of [Rescueland](https://github.com/hermonochy/Rescueland/blob/main/The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md). This timeline highlights the significant events that shaped Computerland since its establishment and its evolution as a close ally of Rescueland.

## 5630630 BDOTR: The creation of Computerland

Computerland formed roughly the same time as Rescueland, this is not a coincidence as the very nature of the creation of Computerland would not be allowed in this state of the universe. The sentient electricity was not sentient at this point. The reason it is sentient remains unknown but it seems to learn and evolve in a manner similar to life, but without the limitation of death.

## 3653454 BTOTR: The evolution of sentience

This time is when the sentient electricity of Computerland gained its setience. At this point the hive minded nature of the elecricity was divided into multiple individuals, but still with the option to be a part of the hive mind to donate knowledge, communicate, and learn.

## 2950670 BROTR: The understanding of science

At this time the beings of Computerland learnt the nature of the universe, which in turn boosted the number of scientific discoveries significantly, now that they knew the laws that the universe followed.

## 0134233 BDOTR: Discovery of the multiverse

After a long scientific mission to the edge of their universe where many high speed colisions were measured at the border of existence, they discovered a single particle outside their universe, confirming that there are many more realities. Although they did not have the power to break the barrier at this point, they knew that their time would come.

## 14 ADOTR: Discovery of Rescueland

In an important moment for intergalactic relationships, Computerland discovered Rescueland during its early space explorations. The people of Computerland learned about Rescuelandâ€™s fight against the tyrants of Bad Guy Land and recognized their shared objective of resisting oppression. This key first contact set the stage for a strong alliance, uniting them to pool their strengths and collaborate cohesively against their mutual adversary.

## 15 ADOTR: The breach of the universal border

After the successful alliance with Rescueland, they managed to learn and borrow some tech from them to travel between universes. This allowed Computerland to realise the full threat of Bad Guy land, which they had previously only seen the scout ships of.
