[Computerland](./The%20Planet%20File.md#computerland-i) is an extraordinary planet composed of a [Conductium](./The%20Technology%20of%20Rescueland%2C%20Computerland%20and%20it's%20surrounding%20Planets.md#conductium-c-con-duct-ee-umm) core and sentient electricity, characterized by its unique technological advancement and cooperative relations with the [Rescueland Empire](./The%20Planet%20File.md#rescueland-empire). However, it's history is relatively uneventful compared to that of [Rescueland](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md). This timeline highlights the significant events that shaped Computerland since its establishment and its evolution as a close ally of Rescueland.

## 5630630 BDOTR: The Creation of Computerland

Computerland formed around the same time as Rescueland, and this alignment is no coincidence. The phenomenon of sentient electricity and the unique environment of Computerland could only manifest under specific conditions present at that moment in the universe's history. Initially, the electricity that filled the planet did not possess sentience; however, the exact reason for its subsequent awakening remains shrouded in mystery. Remarkably, the electricity began to learn and evolve, exhibiting behavioral patterns akin to biological life forms but without the limitations imposed by mortality.

## 3653454 BTOTR: The Evolution of Sentience

During this era, the sentient electricity of Computerland successfully gained full self-awareness. The once-hive-minded electricity experienced a transformative divide, resulting in the emergence of individual consciousness. Although capable of existing as separate beings, these individuals retained the ability to connect back to the hive mind, allowing them to donate knowledge, communicate, and learn from one another while still maintaining their unique identities.

## 2950670 BROTR: The Understanding of Science

At this time the beings of Computerland learnt the nature of the universe. They began to decipher the fundamental principles of nature, drastically increasing their capacity for scientific discovery. Armed with this newfound understanding, they unlocked countless innovations and established a foundation for more profound explorations of existence.

## 0134233 BDOTR: Discovery of the Multiverse

Through an extensive scientific expedition to the boundaries of their universe, the beings of Computerland endeavored to measure high-speed collisions occurring near the threshold of existence. Their relentless pursuit of knowledge culminated in a breakthrough: a solitary particle beyond their universe, confirming the existence of other multiverses. While their current technology did not permit them to breach the barrier separating these realities, they knew that their time would come.

## 14 ADOTR: Discovery of Rescueland

In an important moment for intergalactic relationships, Computerland discovered Rescueland during its early space explorations. The people of Computerland learned about Rescueland’s fight against the tyrants of [Bad Guy Land](./The%20Planet%20File.md#bad-guy-land-previously-b) and recognized their shared objective of resisting oppression. This key first contact set the stage for a strong alliance, uniting them to pool their strengths and collaborate cohesively against their mutual adversary.

## 15 ADOTR: The Breach of the Universal Border

After the successful alliance with Rescueland, they managed to learn and borrow some tech from them to travel between universes. With this new technology, Computerland fully comprehended the extent of the danger posed by Bad Guy Land, which they had hitherto only glimpsed through the occasional scout ship.

## 559 ADOTR: The Destruction of Computerland

In the aftermath of the defeat of Rescueland by the [Rebel 10 faction](./The%20Planet%20File_555.md#rebel-10), which had previously been infiltrated by [Recola](./The%20Planet%20File.md#recola-s), a select group of Rescuelanders found refuge in Computerland; however, this brief period of refuge was swiftly disrupted by the brewing conflict.  Helucky's forces, emboldened by their recent tactical victories, began to mobilize and prepare for an offensive against Computerland, ultimately executing a surprise, unprovoked attack on the digital sanctuary. 
As Helucky systematically built up their fleet of battleships capable of transporting their massive numbers of interceptors across the gargantuan expanse of space to Computerland, the inhabitants of the planet found themselves completely caught off guard. The suddenness and ferocity of the assault compelled the population to hurriedly organize defenses, which were hampered by the overwhelming might of Helucky’s military might. 
Recognizing the brewing catastrophe, Computerland's governing officials swiftly implemented a comprehensive defensive strategy aimed at mitigating the invasion's impact while ensuring the security of their citizens. They mobilized available resources, fortifying key sectors and rallying the populace to stand united against the oncoming threat. In tandem, leadership made the grave decision to initiate evacuation plans, orchestrating the rapid preparation of vessels intended to transport essential personnel and vulnerable citizens to safer territories. 
Unfortunately, these evacuation efforts faced devastating setbacks. As the Helucky onslaught intensified, numerous evacuation vessels were systematically targeted and destroyed, leaving the defenders with minimal options. Amidst the chaos, only a limited number of ships successfully navigated the perilous conditions, securing a small group of survivors while the majority faced impending doom. 

As the situation rapidly escalated and evacuation attempts were increasingly thwarted, Computerland's leadership was forced to consider extreme measures to preserve what remained of their civilization. Acknowledging the desperate circumstances, the governing bodies resolved to undertake a last-ditch effort of monumental significance. The sentient electrical beings devised a bold plan: to channel the planet's substantial electrical energy from its molten Conductium core. 
This complex orchestration of energy manipulation was an extraordinary endeavor that combined intricate technical knowledge with urgent necessity. As the leaders executed this intricate plan, the temperature within the Conductium core began to rise sharply, eventually surpassing its established melting point. With the accumulation of energy reaching critical levels, the Conductium transitioned into a gaseous state, igniting a series of unpredictable and intensely volatile reactions. 
The energy discharge that followed was cataclysmic. Exceeding both practical and theoretical limits, the resulting explosion obliterated everything within its blast radius, culminating in the total annihilation of Computerland. The force of the detonation unleashed shockwaves that resonated throughout the surrounding space, altering the trajectories of nearby celestial bodies. The scale of this destruction was both total and irrevocable, transforming what had once been a vibrant civilization into an unrecognizable void in the cosmos. 
The consequences of this cataclysm marked the definitive end of Computerland. The loss resonated across adjacent territories, fundamentally changing the dynamics of the region. All contributions from Computerland, including its technological advancements and cultural heritage, were irretrievably erased, leaving behind haunting reminders of the fragility inherent in even the most advanced societies when confronted by relentless aggression.
