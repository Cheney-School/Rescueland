## Weaponry

### Guns

There are 4 main sizes of cannon:A large cannon, a universal cannon, a small cannon and an extra small one.

### Ammo

#### Lasers

Lasers are one of the most common ammunitions of civilian and military ships. Unlike slit bombs, they are regeneratable.

##### Basic Lasers

###### good lasers
- green = most concentrated
- red = most powerful
- yellow = most accurate
- blue = fastest firing
- orange = most common

###### bad lasers
- pink = hottest
- purple = fastest travel
- brown = cheapest
- black = stealthiest

These lasers can be of different power, ranging from a simple stun to planet destroying power. The lasers can also be short range, lashing out like lightning. The advantage of this is that it can manuver, so it almost never misses. There are also drones that have laser tips.

#### Beamers

The second type of laser has three functions: stunning electronics, destroying ships and telekinesis. However, this laser type is limited to 5 km, whereas other weapons have a range of several trillion light years. This makes it impractical in most battles, so it is not very popular. They come in 4 colours of beam: green, red, gold and pink.

#### Slit Bombs

Slit bombs are the most common type of ammo used. They are very basic, simply a sharp projectile, reusable until they go blunt. Some are rocket powered, so they are steerable.

##### Slit bomb types

- Basic slit bombs
- Rocket-powered slit bombs
- Cluster slit bombs
- Deep-penetration slit bombs
- Large-damage slit bombs
- Shielded slit bombs
- Surface to surface slit bombs

##### Machine Guns

These are increadibly small, weak projectiles, cheap but useless in space battle.

#### Explosives

##### Hydro-bombs

This is a very powerful weapon, capable of taking out a small army. They are very expensive however, so use is limited.

##### Rockets

These are simply explosive slit bombs.They were popular until the Federre war, but over-use has now made them a luxury.
