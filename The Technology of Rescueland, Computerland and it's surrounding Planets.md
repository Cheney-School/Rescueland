## Materials

### Darkmaterial, Greymaterial, and Lightmaterial (U)

Darkmaterial is an extremely rare substance that many factions vie for due to its unique properties. It is nearly indestructible, surpassed only by Force Field Gel. Greymaterial and Lightmaterial are chemically identical to Darkmaterial but serve different functions.
Darkfighters, Greyfighters, and Lightfighters

#### Darkfighters, Greyfighters and Lightfighters

One of the most notable applications of these materials is the construction of virtually indestructible fighter ships. There are only two known methods for destroying these vessels. The most common method involves propelling them at nearly infinite speed into a field of Force Field Gel. Alternatively, [Mutant FFG](#mutant-ffg) can be employed as a cutting tool; although this method is simpler and more cost-effective, it is restricted to the exclusive users of this rare material, the inhabitants of Rescueland. 

The creation of these fighters requires careful shaping of the material through the process of slamming small Force Field Gel balls into the machinery at the exact speed and precision needed. This is why planets that manage to acquire Force Field Gel tend to conserve it, rather than use it to the protection of their ships. The process of manufacturing these fighters is the most expensive known across the multiverse, which is why only a few dozen exist, although production rates are slowly increasing. Consequently, these ships are considered the equivalent of atomic bombs.

### Techanda (U) Teh-chuhn-dahh

Techanda is a versatile and durable material known for its cost-effectiveness in construction and manufacturing. Its dull, muted colors range from peach to brown, giving it an unassuming appearance. Despite being a strong material, Techanda is not an efficient conductor of heat or electricity, making it less suitable for applications requiring high thermal or electrical performance. This alloy typically forms in fibrous structures, allowing it to be moulded and manipulated easily; however, it can split under certain stress conditions, due to its layered composition.

Several isotopes of Techanda exist, but only a few are regularly employed for practical applications, each engineered to balance toughness and cost. Notably, it does not rust like traditional metals but tends to weaken when subjected to prolonged exposure to water or humidity, making it important to consider environmental factors in its usage.

#### Common Uses:
- Ship Supports: Used as structural elements in ship design due to its strength-to-weight ratio.
- Slit Bombs: Employed as the main material for slit bombs.
- Bases: Forms the foundational frameworks for research bases.
- Antennae: Used in the construction of various communications and sensor antennae.

### Eleha (R) Ellieeh-hah

Eleha is hailed as one of the finest metals, celebrated for its superior toughness and extraordinary inertness regarding chemical reactions. Its shimmering silver surface not only contributes to its visual appeal but also serves functional purposes, as the metal exhibits excellent conductivity for both heat and electricity. With melting temperatures that rival or exceed those of conductium and Darkmaterial, Eleha is a favoured choice for high-performance applications; however, it is important to note that it can eventually succumb to rusting if not properly treated.

The scarcity of this metal makes it significantly more expensive compared to other metals, but the investment is often justified by its outstanding performance characteristics.

#### Common Uses:
- Wires: Utilised in high-speed data and power transmission systems.
- Slit Bombs: Integrated into some slit bombs, due to it's toughness.
- Heat Shields: High melting temperature allows it to protect a spacecraft constantly exposed to extreme heat.
- Gears: Employed in sophisticated machinery where strength and precision are required for operational efficiency.
- Hinges: Crafted for robust movable parts in various applications, where durability is critical.

### Pakira (U) Pack-ear-ahh

Pakira is recognized for its affordability and malleability, making it a popular choice in bulk production. However, it is important to note that pakira is highly reactive to both fire and water, necessitating careful handling and storage to prevent deterioration. Most of the ships manufactured within the Rescueland Empire are constructed from a particularly tough isotope of this metal.

Despite its reactivity, when properly alloyed or coated, pakira can serve functional purposes while maintaining structural integrity, particularly in maritime and atmospheric applications.

#### Common Uses:
- Main Frame of Ships: Acts as the foundational material, giving ships their primary structure and form.
- Wings: Utilised in the construction of aircraft wings, combining lightness with sufficient strength for flight.
- Some Cannon Types: Employed in the production of certain types of cannon, benefiting from its moldability.


### Plamea (U) Plam-meha

Plamea is a cost-effective yet brittle material, characterised by a relatively low melting point. Some of its isotopes possess a degree of toughness, but overall, it tends to be less resilient under stress. Notably, Plamea shares similar chemical properties with Darkmaterial.
Modern interceptors predominantly use Plamea for their main structure, allowing for lightweight designs that are easy to manoeuvre. However, the chemical and physical characteristics of this material necessitate careful design considerations to avoid failures during operation.

#### Common Uses:
- Main Frame of Ships: Serves as a major component in interceptor designs, balancing weight and structural requirements.
- Cannons: Utilised to manufacture most types of cannons where cost and lightweight attributes are prioritised.
- Thrusters: Incorporated in propulsion systems, optimising manoeuvrability.


### Solitme (U) Sol-eet-meh

Solitme is known for its exceptional hardness, making it a reliable choice for applications requiring durability. However, despite its robustness, Solitme is prone to erosion, particularly when exposed to harsh environments. While it is entirely resistant to high temperatures and fire, it reacts negatively with liquids, leading to eventual dissolution if not managed properly. For applications in harsh environments, solitme is preferably coated with nyctron trisulphate.

This set of characteristics makes Solitme particularly useful for specific military applications.

#### Common Uses:
- Large-Damage Slit Bombs: Designed for high-impact offensives, capitalising on its resistance to heat.
- Surface-to-Surface Slit Bombs: Employed in missile designs that require robust materials for launch and impact.
- Single Use (SU) Vehicles: Utilised in expendable military vehicles designed for quick operations before disposal.
- Drones: Incorporated into the construction of drones where lightweight yet durable materials are essential for aerial operations.

### Solita

Solita is similar to Solitme in many ways. However, there are some key differences: while Solitme is resistant to fire, it bends to the will of liquids. However, Solita is liquid-resistant but crumbles if heated. The current interceptor designs use Solita as their main material, able to be built quickly and cheaply.

### Nyctron (U) Nik-tron

Nyctron is a unique alloy known for its lightweight properties and inherent flexibility. It has a dark, almost shadowy hue, making it visually distinct. This metal is slightly luminescent and has a unique property of absorbing ambient light, which can be useful in various applications, particularly in stealth technology. Nyctron holds its own in terms of resistance to environmental stresses, but it is less durable than other metals when faced with blunt force trauma.

#### Common Uses:

- Stealth Technology: Employed in the construction of stealth ships and vehicles, reducing visibility.
- Lightweight Frameworks: Utilised in non-essential structural components where weight savings are critical.
- Fibre Optics: Perfect for transmitting light signals in advanced communication systems.

### Krython (U) Kree-thon

Krython is a rare metal known for its durability and thermal properties. It possesses a brilliant blue sheen and is often coated for aesthetic purposes. Krython acts as a good conductor of heat and electricity while remaining inert to most corrosive agents, with a vastly lower rusting rate than standard metals; thus, it is occasionally sought after for  applications and technology.

#### Common Uses:

- Electronics: Utilised in circuits and microprocessors.
- Minor Heat Exchangers: Employed in systems requiring minor thermal conductivity.

### Vermithium (R) Ver-mih-thi-um

Vermithium is a rare metal known for its distinct reddish hue and metallic lamination. This captivating metal has piezoelectric properties, allowing it to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, making it especially interesting for energy-harvesting applications. Vermithium's strength and flexibility make it exceptional but also relatively rare, resulting in higher costs.

#### Common Uses:

- Energy Harvesters: Incorporated in technologies that convert vibrations or movements into electrical power.
- Weaponry: Used in weapons systems where weight and energy efficiency are critical.
Infrastructure: Utilised in structures where flexibility and energy generation are needed.

### Quorite (U) Kwor-ite

Quorite is an ultra-durable and low-density metal recognized for its unique resistance to wear and tear. Its surface has a distinctive matte finish, and it is often employed in high-risk applications due to its capacity to withstand extreme conditions. While it is not as commonly available as cheaper metals, its unique properties make it valuable in specialised fields.

#### Common Uses:

- Protective Coatings: Often applied as a surface treatment for vehicles and machinery to enhance longevity.
- High-Stress Components: Utilised in situations requiring materials that can endure physical abuse.
- Military Gear: Employed in armour systems and protective wear.

### Conductium \(C\) con-duct-ee-umm
Conductium is what the Center of Computerland is made of. It has a 100% electrical transfer efficiency and is roughly as dense as hydrogen, even though the atom is 300 times bigger than francium. The conductuim atom has 24 protons and 2000 neutrons but only 1 electron. This is the reason it is good at keeping electrons. To extract the electron, you need a special isotope of conductium. The bonds conductium makes are almost indestructible and because of this harvesting and moulding the material is incredibly expensive. This has the upside of only melting at the same temperature as dark material, although this is a bad idea as the neutron structure will deform. The uses of conductium include:

- High accuracy electrical transfer.
- \(uinfinity_t\)-1 speed electron cannons.
- Cross planet power transfer.
- Quantum research \(the atom size helps with research\).

### Atomon \(C\) ah-tom-on
Atomon is a very small atom, roughly the size of hydrogen but has the upside of being very thin, small, and strong for electrical insulation. The reason Atomon is so strong is because it forms when an extremely high voltage flows through pure hydrogen \(mandatory no explosions occur\) for around 1,000,000 years and two hydrogen atoms half merge and lose one electron. This means whenever electricity tries to pass through, it will work because of the spare electron spot. However, due to the half merged state when two electrons try to pass through in a short span of the time \(high power electricity\) it will try to accept two electrons and then reject them immediately and not allow any current to flow. The most common use case for this is very reliable and reusable high power fuses.

   	 
# Rescueland Robots (R)

Aside from Super Owls, the main civilians of Rescueland are Rescueland robots, such as FCRT's.

## Robot Personality

Rescueland Robots are designed with a unique personality that sets them apart from normal robots. This is a result of an innovative gas injected every hundred years, known informally as "Rescueland Gas." This gas, though unknown why, causes the robots to have emotions, thoughts and imaginations. As a result, these robots become more than machines; they exhibit the characteristics of living beings.
The emotional spectrum of a Rescueland Robot is as complex as a living one, allowing them to engage meaningfully with the world around them. In the event of gas having been entirely consumed, behaviour reverts to that of a conventional robot. Each robot has a distinct personality that remains unchanged after replenishing the consumed gas.

## Robot Versions

Rescueland Robots are constantly undergoing upgrades and enhancements that can result in new iterations, often warranting a change in their designation. Each version reflects improvements in technology and functionalities.

### Notable Versions:

- Super Two's: This is the first design of robot, gifted to the Super Owls by Klesone.
- FRJ's: The longest-reigning robot type, remaining unchanged until 105 ADOTR.
- Hulk Super FRJ's: A more powerful version of the FRJ's, specifically designed for battle against Horsa.
- UF's: A large and powerful type of robot specifically tasked to act as bodyguards.
- FRT's: A prototype version of the FCRT's.
- FCRT's: Currently the most modern type of robot are the FCRT's.

## Robot Types

Rescueland Robots are categorised into eight major groups, each with different jobs and capabilities.

### Types in order of population

- Regular FCRT's: These FCRT's are the most common type, acting as both civilians and soldiers.

![](images/RegularFCRT.png)

- Pilot FCRT's: These FCRT's specialise in piloting all transports.

![](images/PilotFCRT.png)

- Spy FCRT's: These FCRT's are disguised as an asteroid, equipped with extra cloaking devices and built to spy on enemy locations.

# Ships and their Systems

## Engines

### Engine Types

There are many different types and colours of engine each with different properties and price.

### Engine Colours

- 🟢️ = most concentrated engine (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful engine (R)
- 🟡️ = most compact engine (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest startup engine (R)
- ⚪️ = cleanest engine (R)
- 🟠️ = most common engine (U)

- 🩷 = fastest engine (H)
- 🟣️ = hottest engine (H)
- 🟤️ = cheapest engine (H)
- ⚫️ = quietest and coldest engine (Re)

## General

### Energy Scoop (R)

This is a device that allows kinetic energy to be transformed into higher entropy fuel and back again with negligible loss, essentially 'scooping' the energy. This can't be used as the main power supply though, because the energy density is low, so it is impractical to store sufficient energy for long distance journeys. Instead, it is usually used as a regenerative brake, providing energy for subsequent acceleration.

### Atmospheric Bubble (R)

The Atmospheric Bubble is a technology that enables atmospheric vehicles to transition into outer space. When activated, a protective "bubble" is created around the vehicle, creating an artificial atmosphere that allows it to traverse the vacuum of space without issues such as the lack of air. This advanced mechanism not only ensures the safety of the crew and passengers but also optimizes the vehicle's performance during interstellar travel.

### Teleporter (R + C)

In a remarkable collaboration, Rescueland and Computerland successfully developed a teleportation device, allowing for Instantaneous jumps anywhere. However, this technology comes with numerous challenges that limit its practical use. 

For one, the teleportation process cannot transport objects or individuals within a Force Field Gel, which significantly restricts its applicability in various scenarios, such as jumping into a dangerous environment. Additionally, those who undergo teleportation experience a great deal of pain during the process, making it an undesirable option for many. The device also demands an immense amount of power to operate. Furthermore, it cannot execute a teleportation into a completely enclosed space, which further limits its usability. 

As a result of these limitations, the teleportation device is not often utilized, even though it represents a remarkable technological achievement in the realm of interdimensional travel.

# Military

## Defence

### Force Field Gel (R)

The only known defence that is almost completely impenetrable is Force Field Gel. Only two known weaknesses exist: Time and [Mutant FFG](#mutant-ffg). This is a defence that only Rescueland has in mass, though some have managed to aqquire small quantities of it. NOTHING can get in OR out, effectively taking you out of the battle. Thus, many ships only use this defence when they are damaged, or a retreat is required. Another anomaly about FFG is that they behave in a similar manner to non-newtonian substances: The faster something hits the forcefield, the more energy is absorbed into it and not the object itself.

#### The process of harvesting FFG

The Force Field Gel is harvested from a well on Rescueland. The dimensions of the well are 1m-1m-5km to the exact planck. It is directly under the main runway of Rescueland, a trick which has protected the location of the well since it was discovered. When the gel is consumed, the well always refills itself over the period of a Rescueland day. The provenance of the matter is unknown. The gel also doesn't seem to be made of atoms, no matter how closely studied.

#### Activating the FF

Once the Force Field is ready to be activated, it is ejected as a very thin tube. It spreads out until it surrounds the entire ship, where it solidifies, making the object inside impenetrable. The entire process takes about 1 second, but due to its size, the FFG protecting Rescueland takes several minutes to set up.

One limitation is that it needs to be taken down every 10 years. After about 50 years, cracks start to appear on the shield and, after 100, the force field cracks apart and dissipates.

#### Mutant FFG

 This variant of FFG has a green tinge, rather than an orange one, and can last for 10 times the length of the regular FF. Only a tiny sample of Mutant FFG exists, found onboard an ancient battleship. However, the biggest difference is that it destroys, rather than repels, whatever it comes in contact with, including other FFG's. The process of making it is unknown, though scientists suspect it may have something to do with the ring that was crushed while the particular batch was being made. The discovery also revolutionised the production of darkfighters, which is why, to this day, Rescueland still has the most darkfighters of all.

### Plasma Force Fields (U)

Plasma Force Fields are the standard type of defense employed by most planets, recognized as one of the most effective protective measures available (second only to the FFG). This force field manifests as a blue sheen that hovers approximately 1 cm above the ship's surface. Unlike the FFG, the Plasma Force Field is transmissive to on-board projectiles, but it can only withstand a limited number of attacks—typically just a few dozen—before it requires regeneration.

### Magnetic Force Fields (L)

Magnetic Force Fields are designed specifically to deflect certain types of slit bombs by generating an electromagnetic field around the vessel. However, they are not universally effective, as some slit bombs do not possess magnetic properties. Additionally, these fields may not be able to stop a rapid direct hit, although they can help slow down the projectile. Most ships deploy these shields during combat, but their use becomes impractical when operating in close formation.

### The Verdant Shield Projector (R)

The Verdant Shield Projector is an innovative defensive system designed to protect Rescueland until the FFG is activated. This technology generates an energy shield composed of charged particles that can absorb and dissipate kinetic energy, as well as provide a barrier against certain projectile weapons.

Functionality: The shield can be deployed quickly in the field and adjusts its energy output based on the level of incoming threat. For example, it can absorb the impact of small arms fire and provide cover against explosion shockwaves.
Strengths: Highly effective against conventional weapons and offers additional environmental protection (e.g., against chemical or biological agents).
Weaknesses: The shield has limited duration and can be drained by sustained attacks. It also has trouble with high-velocity projectiles or directed-energy weapons. The newest version, the VSP-7, features improved energy efficiency and integration with personal armour systems.

### Energy Absorption Shields (R)
This shield absorbs and converts incoming energy attacks into usable power for the ship’s systems. Essentially, it can turn enemy fire into a source of energy for the vessel.
It is widely used, as it enhances ship durability while providing additional power for weapons and systems, creating a feedback loop of sustainability in battle. It does not repel projectiles though, so an additional shield is needed.



### Holo-Decoy Defense System (R)
Holo-Decoy systems utilise advanced holographic technology to create realistic illusions of the ship, confusing targeting algorithms and shielding enemy weapons. However, advanced radars are not fooled, so it can only be used for a few seconds at a time.
#### Holo-Decoy types:

- Standard Holo-Decoy: Creates a simple holographic projection of the ship, distracting some enemy fire.
- Multi Holo-Decoy: Creates multiple images of the ship at once, each moving independently to confuse targeting systems.
- Active Holo-Decoy: Mimics firing patterns and manoeuvres of the actual ship, making it more convincing.
- Signal-Reflecting Decoy: Sends out false signals to confuse enemy sensors, leading attackers to engage imaginary threats.
- Adaptive Holo-Cloak: Integrates with the ship's systems to blend in with backgrounds, effectively rendering it less visible to intrusions.


### FCRT DarkArmour (R)

DarkArmour is an FCRT defensive layer plated only a few femtometers thick, making it hard to destroy an FCRT, even if not FFG protected. A successful attack requires shooting under the layers of plates for having even a remote chance of destroying the FCRT.

## Weaponry

### Cannons (U)

Cannons serve as the primary armament on military vessels, enabling the discharge of lasers and projectiles. The barrel can be equipped with a laser generator, a 'catapult' mechanism for launching projectiles, or left unmodified to launch guided slit bombs. Their versatility make the cannons a popular choice. There are four primary sizes of cannons available: large, universal, small, and extra small.

#### The Large Cannon

Designed for high-impact operations, this cannon is capable of launching fast-loading slit bombs, large-damage slit bombs, and laser drones.

#### The Universal Cannon

As the most widely utilized cannon size, the universal cannon can fire a variety of munitions, including basic slit bombs, cluster slit bombs, deep-penetration slit bombs, shielded slit bombs, basic lasers, machine guns, and rockets.

#### The Small Cannon

This cannon is compatible with basic lasers, rockets, and a single cluster slit bomb, making it a compact but effective option.

#### The Extra Small Cannon

This rare cannon is primarily found on smaller vessels, such as the Helucky darkfighters. It is designed to accommodate only extra-small slit bombs and basic lasers.

### Ammo

#### Lasers

Lasers are one of the most common ammunition of civilian and military ships. These lasers are different to normal lasers, as they travel at 10 g. plex times the speed of light. Unlike slit bombs, they are regeneratable.

##### Basic Lasers

- 🟢️ = most concentrated (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful (R)
- 🟡️ = most accurate (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest firing (R)
- ⚪️ = purest(least energy wasted) (R)
- 🟠️ = most common (U)

- 🩷 = fastest shot (H)
- 🟣️ = hottest (H)
- 🟤️ = cheapest (H)
- ⚫️ = stealthiest(almost impossible to detect) (Re)

These lasers can be of different power, ranging from a simple stun shot to planet destroying power. The lasers can also be short range, lashing out of a cannon like lightning. The advantage of this is that it can manoeuvre, so it almost never misses. There are also laserdrones, which are rocket propelled tubes that have laser tips.

##### Beamers (R+H+F)

This second type of laser has three functions: stunning , destroying and telekinesis. However, this laser type is difficult to aim and is limited to 5 km, whereas other weapons have a range of several trillion light years. This makes it impractical in most battles, so it is not very popular. They come in 4 colours of beam: green, red, gold and pink.


##### Hyperion Fusion Cannons (C)

These fusion-based weapons convert atomic energy into focused blasts. The cannons can also vary their output intensity, allowing for both wide-area suppression and pinpoint strikes. They have a multi-purpose functionality, enabling tactical versatility and devastating offensive power, perfect for engaging multiple targets or focusing on a single high-value enemy ship. These can be repelled by most shields though, so are not commonly used.

##### Solar Beam Projectors (L)

This weapon produces an enormous energy beam that harnesses the power of a star to discharge concentrated energy onto a target ship, resulting in disintegration of the hull and systems. Capable of crippling many ships with a single blast, they are effective across vast distances and are usually fired from a planet.


##### FCRT Lasers

###### P-series Laser (R)

The P-series were the first steerable laser designs, producing a thin, red beam which can latch onto a target and follow it indefinitely. P-series laser reactions are slow though, so it is possible to avoid impact by putting an object between you and the laser. It is also quite weak, and it would take several shots to take someone down. The newest model is the P-45.

###### TL-series (R)

The TL series is similar to the P-series, but it is a larger, green beam. It is also more powerful and faster manoeuvring, but it requires a lot more power, so a regular FCRT can use this for a maximum of 88 seconds worth of beam. The newest model is the TL-34.

###### Laser Hair (R)

FCRT's have no hair, but can activate short lasers sticking out of their heads,usually during battle. It can be used to ram their target, a bit like a bayonet. Some FCRT's even style it like hair, but they usually don't bother.

###### Granite Laser (C)

The Granite Laser is a weapon designed by Computerland, but is usually used by the FCRT. Though technically not a laser, this weapon acts so much like one that it has been named The Granite Laser. It fires a beam of molten granite at the target, engulfing them. The granite solidifies as soon as it hits, immobilising the target until it is broken free.

#### Slit Bombs (U)

Slit bombs are the most common type of ammo used. They are very basic, simply a sharp projectile, reusable until they go blunt. Some are rocket powered, so they are steerable.

##### Slit bomb types

- Basic slit bombs: These are simply sharp projectiles
- Rocket-powered slit bombs: These slit bombs are rocket powered, so can steer and return to the owner after use.
- Fast-load slit bombs: These are built to be loaded quickly into the cannon, and can be launched within a few milliseconds of one another.
- Cluster slit bombs: These are smaller slit bombs, so many can be launched at once. Therefore, many targets can be hit at once.
- Extra-small slit bombs: These are tiny slit bombs, rarely used due to their ineffectiveness. The only current users of this slit bomb are the Helucky Darkfighters.
- Deep-penetration slit bombs: These are very thin slit bombs, used to penetrate particular deep. They are the main slit bomb type that use eleha.
- Large-damage slit bombs: These are the opposite of deep-penetration slit bombs, broad and blunt. Due to this, a very powerful cannon is required to launch these.
- Shielded slit bombs: This slit bomb is single use, with a shield at the front that breaks off shortly before impact. They are also made of eleha.
- Surface to surface slit bombs: These are slit bombs that are purely rocket powered, launched from one planet to hit another planet. They are made of solitme.

#### Machine Guns (L)

These are incredibly small, weak projectiles, cheap but useless in space battle. They are mainly used in battles against 'inferior' races (tech level 6 or under).

#### Tachyon Launchers (L)

These launchers fire projectiles that harness tachyon particles. They were capable of striking targets before they had time to react, but now they are considered slow, so are now rarely used. They can be repelled by FFG's, Darkmaterial and Plasma Force Fields.

#### The Mega Flail (Ho)

The Mega Flail is a spiked ball which is attached to a ship's belly. When required, it will be launched from a ship's belly and crush or spike whatever is below it. It will then be pulled back with a rope attached to it. The only army that uses this is the Horsa army.

### Explosives

#### Hydro-bombs (R+H+F)

This is a very powerful bomb, capable of taking out a small army. When the bomb hits the surface, it implodes from the pressure. The force causes the shell to break apart, and the explosives inside explode at full force. The shock-wave of the bomb travels outward in a ripple, destroying anything in it's path. They are very expensive however, so use is limited.

##### Types of hydro-bomb

- Quick-succession bomb- these are meant to be fired quickly, one after the other. The first is to weaken the target, the second to destroy it and the third to destroy all remaining parts.
- Surprise bomb- this is a bomb that lets out one lethal shot, giving the enemy no chance to resist.
- Mini bomb- these are tiny bombs meant to take out a single target. These are not so good though, since the power scales cubically.

#### Rockets (L)

These are simply explosive slit bombs. They were popular until the Federre war, but overuse has now made them a luxury.

### Chemicals
#### Acid thrower (L)

The acid thrower is an ancient weapon last used in the Horsa war. This design is simple. It acts as a water gun firing highly concentrated acid, dissolving what it touches. This weapon is now rarely used, due to the time needed for it to take effect.

### Sound

#### Sonic Blasters (L)

Utilising sound-wave propagation, Sonic Blasters deliver concussive blasts capable of damaging internal organs and shattering structures without traditional explosive means.
However, they have long since been forgotten as they only work on living organisms and only in an atmosphere.

### Electromagnetic Pulse (L)

The Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) is a simple but effective piece of technology designed to incapacitate electronic systems and disrupt communication networks. It operates using electromagnetic principles and can range in scale from portable units to large-scale weapons deployed from vehicles or aircraft. The EMP is seen as a non-lethal alternative to traditional explosives, making it a strategic choice in modern warfare and electronic countermeasures.
#### EMP Types:

- Focused EMP Projector: A portable device that emits a targeted burst of electromagnetic energy, designed to disable enemy electronics in a specific area without causing physical destruction to infrastructure. Typically used by special operations units.

- Vehicle-Mounted EMP Cannon: A more powerful version designed to be mounted on military vehicles. Capable of producing a wide arc of disruption, taking out multiple electronic systems within a defined radius. Ideal for battlefield scenarios where multiple enemy vehicles and drones are present.

- Aerial EMP Drone: Small, agile drones equipped with miniaturised EMP emitters. They can fly into enemy territory and deploy a localised EMP to disrupt communications, providing a tactical advantage to ground forces. They are often used for reconnaissance missions that rely on stealth.

- Satellite-Based EMP Array: A large-scale system capable of generating a high-altitude EMP over a vast area. This system can be activated remotely to impact entire regions, knocking out grid systems, communications, and critical infrastructure with precision. It's engineered to be a deterrent against large-scale conflicts.

- Portable Microwave EMP Generator: This compact device generates focused microwave bursts capable of disrupting the electronics of nearby vehicles or drones. It can be disguised as regular equipment, allowing operatives to deploy it covertly, limiting detection and retaliation.

- Cybernetic EMP Field: A system designed to create a localised EMP field around a specific area, protecting it from electronic surveillance and attacks. Often integrated into military installations or VIP protection protocols, it can shield sensitive equipment and personnel from electronic threats.


### Bunkers

#### Anti-bunker catapult (L)

The anti-bunker catapult is the most common method to destroy the bunker of the enemy. A massive weight, several km long and super dense, is launched from a catapult (also massive!) onto the bunker, but shortly before impact the entire weight is concentrated into a small area, just a few metres across, and crushes a hole into the bunker. However, the bunker usually collapses from the damage, destroying everything inside. Therefore, it can't always be used.

#### Anti-bunker drill (R+B)

The anti-bunker drill is the method Rescueland uses when they need to capture the bunker. It drills through the ground at incredible speeds, several thousand km/h. However, it is still slower than the anti-bunker catapult, and more expensive, which is why it is not used as often. The hole it drills is 8 metres across. It can drill into the bunker from any direction, except if it is protected by Darkmaterial or FFG.
