## Defence

### Force Field Gel (R)

The only known defence that is completely impregnable is the Force Field Gel. This is a defence that only Rescueland has, though many have attempted to get some. NOTHING can get in OR out, effectively taking you out of the battle. Thus, many battleships only use this when they are damaged or a retreat is required. Another anomaly about them is that they behave like non-newtonian substances. The faster something hits the forcefield, the more energy is absorbed into the forcefield and not the object inside.

#### The process of harvesting FFG

The Force Field Gel is harvested from a well on Rescueland. The dimensions of the well are 1m-1m-5km to the exact planck. It is directly under the main runway of Rescueland, a trick which has protected the location of the well scince it was discovered. When the gel is consumed, the well always refills itself over the period of a Rescueland day. The provinience of the matter is unknown. The gel also doesn't seem to be made of atoms, no matter how closely studied. 

#### Activating the FF

Once the Force Field is ready to be activated, it is ejected as a very thin tube. It spreads out until it surrounds the entire ship, where it solidifies and becomes solid, making the object inside impenetrable. The entire process takes about 1 second, but the FF protecting Rescueland takes several minutes to build up.

One limitation is that it needs to be taken down every 10 years. This is because one weakness of the FFG is time. After 50 years, cracks start to appear on the shield and, after 100, the force field cracks apart and dissipates.

### Plasma Force Fields (R+C)

This is the kind of force field that all other planets use. It is the most effective of all defences (except for the FFG). It creates a blue sheen 1 cm above the surface of the ship. Unlike the FFG, the Plasma Force Field is transmissive to on-board projectiles, but it can only repel a few dozen attacks before it needs to regenerate.

### Magnetic Force Fields (R)

These force fields are purely meant to deflect some slit bombs, creating an electromagnetic field around the ship. However, this does not work on all slit bombs, as some are not magnetic. It also won't deflect a direct shot traveling fast enough, though it may slow it down. Most ships have these shields on during battle, though it is impractical when flying in close formation.

### FCRT DarkArmour (R)

Dark is a defence that FCRT's carry. They have very thin plates of Darkmaterial (see below) on them, which is why it is hard to destroy an FCRT even without a FFG. The attacker is required to get under the layers of plates in order to land a shot that has even a remote chance of destroying the FCRT.


## Darkmaterial, Greymaterial and Lightmaterial (R)

Darkmaterial is a very rare substance, fought for by many. Grey and Lightmaterial are chemically identical to Darkmaterial, but are used for different things.

### Darkfighters, Greyfighters and Lightfighters

The most famous use of this substance is to build practically indestructible fighters. The only known way to destroy these ships is to slam them at an almost infinite speed into a Force Field Gel. This is also how they are made. The material needs to be shaped into a fighter by slamming small Force Field Gel balls into the machine at the necessary speed and precision. This is why the little Force Field Gel that other planets obtain is saved, should they find some Darkmaterial. The process is the most expensive one known in the entire multiverse, which is why there are only a few dozen of them, though they are increasing in number. Therefore, these ships are, in a way, the atomic bombs of the multiverse.


## Weaponry

### Guns (R)

There are 4 main sizes of cannon: A large cannon, a universal cannon, a small cannon and an extra small one.

#### The large cannon 

This cannon is used for fast-load slit bombs, Large-damage slit bombs and lightdrones.

#### The universal cannon

This is the most common cannon, which can launch basic slit bombs, cluster slit bombs, deep-penetration slit bombs, shielded slit bombs, basic lasers, machine guns and rockets.

#### The small cannon

This cannon fits basic lasers, rockets and a single cluster slit bomb.

#### The extra small cannon

This cannon is rarely used, the main usage being the Helucky darkfighters. It can fit only extra-small slit bombs and basic lasers.

### Ammo

#### Lasers

Lasers are one of the most common ammunitions of civilian and military ships. These lasers are different to normal lasers, as they travel at 10 g. plex times the speed of light. Unlike slit bombs, they are regeneratable.

##### Basic Lasers (R)

- 🟢️ = most concentrated (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful (R)
- 🟡️ = most accurate (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest firing (R)
- ⚪️ = purest(least energy wasted) (R)
- 🟠️ = most common (R)

- 🩷 = fastest shot (B)
- 🟣️ = hottest (B)
- 🟤️ = cheapest (B)
- ⚫️ = stealthiest (B)

These lasers can be of different power, ranging from a simple stun to planet destroying power. The lasers can also be short range, lashing out like lightning. The advantage of this is that it can manuver, so it almost never misses. There are also Lightdrones that have laser tips.

#### Beamers (R)

The second type of laser has three functions: stunning electronics, destroying ships and telekinesis. However, this laser type is limited to 5 km, whereas other weapons have a range of several trillion light years. This makes it impractical in most battles, so it is not very popular. They come in 4 colours of beam: green, red, gold and pink.

#### Slit Bombs (R)

Slit bombs are the most common type of ammo used. They are very basic, simply a sharp projectile, reusable until they go blunt. Some are rocket powered, so they are steerable.

##### Slit bomb types

- Basic slit bombs
- Rocket-powered slit bombs
- Fast-load slit bombs
- Cluster slit bombs
- Extra-small slit bombs
- Deep-penetration slit bombs
- Large-damage slit bombs
- Shielded slit bombs
- Surface to surface slit bombs

#### Machine Guns (R+C)

These are incredibly small, weak projectiles, cheap but useless in space battle.

#### The Mega Flail (R)

The Mega Flail is a spiked ball which is attached to a ship's belly. When required, it will be launched from a ships belly and crush or spike whatever is below it. It will then be pulled back with a rope attached to it. The only army that uses this is the Horsa army.

#### Explosives

##### Hydro-bombs (R)

This is a very powerful bomb, capable of taking out a small army. When the bomb hits the surface, it implodes from the pressure. The force causes the shell to break apart, and the explosives inside expolade at full force. The shockwave of the bomb travels outward in a ripple, destroying anything in it's path. They are very expensive however, so use is limited.

###### Types of hydro-bomb

- Quick-sucsession bomb- these are meant to be fired quickly, one after the other. The first is to weaken the target, the second to destroy it and the third to destroy all remaining parts.
- Suprise bomb- this is a bomb that lets out one leathal shot, giving the enemy no chance to resist.
- Mini bomb- these are tiny bombs meant to take out a single target. These are not so good though, scince the power scales cubicaly.

##### Rockets (R)

These are simply explosive slit bombs. They were popular until the Federre war, but over-use has now made them a luxury.

#### Chemicals
##### Acid thrower

The acid thrower is an ancient weapon last used in the Horsa war. This design is simple. It acts as a water gun firing highly concentrated acid, dissolving what it touches. This weapon is now rarely used, due to the time needed for it to take effect.

#### Bunkers

##### Anti-bunker catapault (R)

The anti-bunker catapault is the most common method to destroy the bunker of the enemy. A massive weight, several km long and super dense, is launched from a catapault (also massive!) onto the bunker, but shortly before impact the entire weight is concentrated into a small area, just a few metres across, and crushes a hole into the bunker. However, the bunker usually collapses from the damage, destroying everything inside. Therefore, it can't always be used.

##### Anti-bunker drill (R)

The anti-bunker drill is the method Rescueland uses when they needs to capture the bunker. It drills through the ground at incredible speeds, several thousand km/h. However, it is still slower than the anti-bunker catapault, and more expensive, which is why it is not used as often. The hole it drills is 8 metres across. It can drill into the bunker from any direction, except if it is protected by darkmaterial or FFG.

## Engines

There are many different types and colours of engine each with different properties and price.

### Engine Colours

- 🟢️ = most concentrated engine (R)

- 🟣️ = hottest engine (B)
- 🟤️ = cheapest engine (B)
- ⚫️ = quietest engine (B)

### Engine Types


## Special Metals
### Conductium (C) con-duct-ee-umm
Conductium is what the Center of computerland is made of. It has a 100% electrical transfer efficentcy and is roughly as dense as hydrogen, even though the atom is 300 times bigger than francium. The conductuim atom has 24 protons and 2000 nutrons but only 1 electron. This is the reason it is good at keeping electrons. To extract the electron, you need a special isotope of conductium. The bonds conductium makes are almost indestructable and because of this harvesting and moulding the material is increadibly expensive. This has the upside of only melting at the same temperature as dark material. \(DO NOT USE AT THAT TEMPRATURE, NEUTRON STARS WILL FORM\). The uses of conductium include:

- High accuracy electrical transfer.
- \(uinfinity_t\)-1 speed electron cannons.
- Cross planet power transfer.
- Quantum reseach \(the atom size helps with research\)

### Techanda (R) Teh-chuhn-dahh

Techanda is a cheap but tough material, dull coloured. It is used for more common objects. It is not a very good conductor of heat and electricity.

Uses are:

- Ship supports
- Slit bombs
- Bases
- Antennae

### Eleha (R) Ellieeh-hah

Eleha is one of the most expensive metals, super tough and unreactive to most things. It also has a similar, if not higher, melting temperature than conductium or Darkmaterial. This metal is shiny and silver.

Uses are:

- Slit bombs
- Heat shields
- Gears
- Hinges

### Pakira (R) Pack-eer-ahh

Pakira is cheap and malleable, and is highly reactive to fire and water. Most ships are made of this metal.

Uses are:

- Main frame of ships
- Wings
- Some cannon types

### Plamea (R) Plam-meha

Plamea is a cheap and brittle material with a low melting point, though some isotopes are relativly tough.This is what the interceptors are mostly made of. This is also the closest element to Darkmaterial.

Uses are:

- Main frame of ships
- Cannons
- Thrusters
