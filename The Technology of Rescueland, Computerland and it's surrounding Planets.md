# General

## Special Metals

### Conductium \(C\) con-duct-ee-umm
Conductium is what the Center of computerland is made of. It has a 100% electrical transfer efficiency and is roughly as dense as hydrogen, even though the atom is 300 times bigger than francium. The conductuim atom has 24 protons and 2000 neutrons but only 1 electron. This is the reason it is good at keeping electrons. To extract the electron, you need a special isotope of conductium. The bonds conductium makes are almost indestructible and because of this harvesting and moulding the material is incredibly expensive. This has the upside of only melting at the same temperature as dark material, although this is a bad idea as the neutron structure will deform. The uses of conductium include:

- High accuracy electrical transfer.
- \(uinfinity_t\)-1 speed electron cannons.
- Cross planet power transfer.
- Quantum research \(the atom size helps with research\)

### Atomon \(C\) ah-tom-on
Atomon is a very small atom, roughly the size of hydrogen but has the upside of being very thin, small, and strong for electrical insulation. The reason Atomon is so strong is because it forms when a extremely high voltage has been flowing through pure hydrogen \(mandatory no explosions occur\) for around 1,000,000 years and two of the hydrogen atoms half merge and loses one electron. This means whenever electricity tries to pass through it will work because of the spare electron spot, but because of the half merged state when two electrons try to pass through in a short span of the time \(high power electricity\) it will try to accept two electrons and then reject them immediately and not allow any current to flow. The most common use case for this is very reliable and reusable high power fuses.

### Techanda (U) Teh-chuhn-dahh

Techanda is a cheap but tough material, dull coloured. It is used for more common objects. It is not a very good conductor of heat and electricity. It usually forms in 'fibres' and therefore can split fairly quickly. There are many different isotopes, but only a few are used regularly. It does not rust, but will weaken when in contact with water for an extended time.

Uses are:

- Ship supports
- Slit bombs
- Bases
- Antennae

### Eleha (R) Ellieeh-hah

Eleha is one of the most expensive metals, super tough and unreactive to most things. It also has a similar, if not higher, melting temperature to conductium or Darkmaterial. This metal is shiny and silver and an excellent conductor of heat and electricity, but will eventually rust.

Uses are:

- Wires
- Slit bombs
- Heat shields
- Gears
- Hinges

### Pakira (U) Pack-eer-ahh

Pakira is cheap and malleable, and is highly reactive to fire and water. Most ships are made of a tough isotope of this metal.

Uses are:

- Main frame of ships
- Wings
- Some cannon types

### Plamea (U) Plam-meha

Plamea is a cheap and brittle material with a low melting point, though some isotopes are relatively tough. This is what most modern interceptors are made of. This is also chemically the closest element to Darkmaterial.

Uses are:

- Main frame of ships
- Cannons
- Thrusters

### Solitme (U) Sol-eet-meh

This is a very hard material, but erodes easily, used for smaller ships. It is completely resistant to fire but reacts to water, eventually dissolving.

Uses are:

- Large-Damage slit bombs
- Surface to surface slit bombs
- SU (Single Use) vehicles
- Drones


### Engine Types

# Ships and their Systems

### Engine Colours

- 🟢️ = most concentrated engine (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful engine (R)
- 🟡️ = most compact engine (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest startup engine (R)
- ⚪️ = cleanest engine (R)
- 🟠️ = most common engine (U)


- 🩷 = fastest engine (H)
- 🟣️ = hottest engine (H)
- 🟤️ = cheapest engine (H)
- ⚫️ = quietest and coldest engine (H)

## General

## Energy Scoop

This is a device that allows kinetic energy to be transferred into fuel and back again with practically no energy loss, essentially 'scooping' the energy out. This can't be used as the main power supply though, because the energy form it creates is not very dense in energy, so it is impossible to store enough for a decent range. Instead, it is usually used as a brake. Then, when the ship needs to accelerate, the energy can be released again.

## Atmospheric Bubble

This is a highly advanced design which allows atmospheric vehicles to enter space. When activated, it creates a 'bubble' in which the vehicle can travel.

# Military

## Defence

### Force Field Gel (R)

The only known defence that is almost completely impenetrable is Force Field Gel. Only two known weaknesses exist: time and Mutant FFG (see below). This is a defence that only Rescueland has, though many have attempted to get some. NOTHING can get in OR out, effectively taking you out of the battle. Thus, many battleships only use this when they are damaged or a retreat is required. Another anomaly about them is that they behave like non-newtonian substances. The faster something hits the forcefield, the more energy is absorbed into the forcefield and not the object inside.

#### The process of harvesting FFG

The Force Field Gel is harvested from a well on Rescueland. The dimensions of the well are 1m-1m-5km to the exact planck. It is directly under the main runway of Rescueland, a trick which has protected the location of the well since it was discovered. When the gel is consumed, the well always refills itself over the period of a Rescueland day. The provinience of the matter is unknown. The gel also doesn't seem to be made of atoms, no matter how closely studied. 

#### Activating the FF

Once the Force Field is ready to be activated, it is ejected as a very thin tube. It spreads out until it surrounds the entire ship, where it solidifies and becomes solid, making the object inside impenetrable. The entire process takes about 1 second, but the FF protecting Rescueland takes several minutes to build up.

One limitation is that it needs to be taken down every 10 years. After 50 years, cracks start to appear on the shield and, after 100, the force field cracks apart and dissipates.

#### Mutant FFG

Only a tiny sample of Mutant FFG exists, found onboard an ancient battleship. This gel has a green tinge, rather than an orange one, and can last for 10 times the length of the regular FF. However, the biggest difference is that it destroys, rather than repels, whatever it comes in contact with, including other FFG's. The process of making it is unknown, though scientists suspect it may have to do with the ring that was crushed while that paticlar batch was being made.

### Plasma Force Fields (U)

This is the kind of force field that all other planets use. It is the most effective of all defences (except for the FFG). It creates a blue sheen 1 cm above the surface of the ship. Unlike the FFG, the Plasma Force Field is transmissive to on-board projectiles, but it can only repel a few dozen attacks before it needs to regenerate.

### Magnetic Force Fields (R+H)

These force fields are purely meant to deflect some slit bombs, creating an electromagnetic field around the ship. However, this does not work on all slit bombs, as some are not magnetic. It also won't deflect a direct shot travelling fast enough, though it may slow it down. Most ships have these shields on during battle, though it is impractical when flying in close formation.

### The Verdant Shield Projector (R)

The Verdant Shield Projector is an innovative defensive system designed to protect Resceland until the FFG is activated. This technology generates an energy shield composed of charged particles that can absorb and dissipate kinetic energy, as well as provide a barrier against certain projectile weapons.

Functionality: The shield can be deployed quickly in the field and adjusts its energy output based on the level of incoming threat. For example, it can absorb the impact of small arms fire and provide cover against explosion shockwaves.
Strengths: Highly effective against conventional weapons and offers additional environmental protection (e.g., against chemical or biological agents).
Weaknesses: The shield has limited duration and can be drained by sustained attacks. It also has trouble with high-velocity projectiles or directed-energy weapons. The newest version, the VSP-7, features improved energy efficiency and integration with personal armour systems.

### Energy Absorption Shields (R)
This shield absorbs and converts incoming energy attacks into usable power for the ship’s systems. Essentially, it can turn enemy fire into a source of energy for the vessel.
It is widely used, as it enhances ship durability while providing additional power for weapons and systems, creating a feedback loop of sustainability in battle. It does not repel projectiles though, so an additional shield is needed.



### Holo-Decoy Defense System (R) 
Holo-Decoy systems utilize advanced holographic technology to create realistic illusions of the ship, confusing targeting algorithms and shielding enemy weapons. However, advanced radars are not fooled, so it can only used for a few seconds at a time.
#### Holo-Decoy types:

- Standard Holo-Decoy: Creates a simple holographic projection of the ship, distracting some enemy fire.
- Multi-Phase Holo-Decoy: Creates multiple images of the ship at once, each moving independently to confuse targeting systems.
- Active Holo-Decoy: Mimics firing patterns and maneuvers of the actual ship, making it more convincing.
- Signal-Reflecting Decoy: Sends out false signals to confuse enemy sensors, leading attackers to engage imaginary threats.
- Adaptive Holo-Cloak: Integrates with the ship's systems to blend in with backgrounds, effectively rendering it less visible to intrusions.




### FCRT DarkArmour (R)

DarkArmour is a defence that FCRT's carry. They have very thin plates of Darkmaterial (see below) on them, only a few femtometres thick, which is why it is hard to destroy an FCRT even without a FFG. The attacker is required to get under the layers of plates in order to land a shot that has even a remote chance of destroying the FCRT.


## Darkmaterial, Greymaterial and Lightmaterial (U)

Darkmaterial is a very rare substance, fought for by many. Grey and Lightmaterial are chemically identical to Darkmaterial, but are used for different things. 

### Darkfighters, Greyfighters and Lightfighters

The most famous use of this substance is to build practically indestructible fighters. The only known way to destroy these ships is to slam them at an almost infinite speed into a Force Field Gel. This is also how they are made. The material needs to be shaped into a fighter by slamming small Force Field Gel balls into the machine at the necessary speed and precision. This is why the little Force Field Gel that other planets obtain is saved, should they find some Darkmaterial. The process is the most expensive one known in the entire multiverse, which is why there are only a few dozen of them, though they are increasing in number. Therefore, these ships are, in a way, the atomic bombs of the multiverse.


## Weaponry

### Guns (U)

There are 4 main sizes of cannon: A large cannon, a universal cannon, a small cannon and an extra small one.

#### The large cannon 

This cannon is used for fast-load slit bombs, Large-damage slit bombs and laserdrones.

#### The universal cannon

This is the most common cannon, which can launch basic slit bombs, cluster slit bombs, deep-penetration slit bombs, shielded slit bombs, basic lasers, machine guns and rockets.

#### The small cannon

This cannon fits basic lasers, rockets and a single cluster slit bomb.

#### The extra small cannon

This cannon is rarely used, the main usage being the Helucky darkfighters. It can fit only extra-small slit bombs and basic lasers.

### Ammo

#### Lasers

Lasers are one of the most common ammunitions of civilian and military ships. These lasers are different to normal lasers, as they travel at 10 g. plex times the speed of light. Unlike slit bombs, they are regeneratable.

##### Basic Lasers

- 🟢️ = most concentrated (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful (R)
- 🟡️ = most accurate (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest firing (R)
- ⚪️ = purest(least energy wasted) (R)
- 🟠️ = most common (U)

- 🩷 = fastest shot (H)
- 🟣️ = hottest (H)
- 🟤️ = cheapest (H)
- ⚫️ = stealthiest (H)

These lasers can be of different power, ranging from a simple stun to planet destroying power. The lasers can also be short range, lashing out like lightning. The advantage of this is that it can manoeuvre, so it almost never misses. There are also laserdrones, which are rocket propelled tubes have laser tips.

##### Beamers (R+H+F)

The second type of laser has three functions: stunning electronics, destroying ships and telekinesis. However, this laser type is limited to 5 km, whereas other weapons have a range of several trillion light years. This makes it impractical in most battles, so it is not very popular. They come in 4 colours of beam: green, red, gold and pink.


##### Hyperion Fusion Cannons (C)

These fusion-based weapons convert atomic energy into focused blasts, capable of incredible damage. The cannons can also vary their output intensity, allowing for both wide-area suppression and pinpoint strikes. They have a multi-purpose functionality, enabling tactical versatility and devastating offensive power, perfect for engaging multiple targets or focusing on a single high-value enemy ship. These can be repelled by most shields though, so are not commonly used.

##### Cataclysm Beam Projectors (R)

This weapon is an enormous energy beam that harness the power of a star to discharge concentrated energy onto a target ship, resulting in catastrophic disintegration of hull and systems. Capable of crippling the most ships with a single blast, they are effective across vast distances and are usually fired from a planet.


##### FCRT Lasers

###### P-series Laser (R)

The P-series were the first steerable laser designs. They produce a thin, red beam which can latch onto a target and follow it indefinitely. It's reactions are slow though, so it is possible to avoid it by putting an object between you and the laser. It is also quite weak, and it would take several shots to take someone down. The newest one is the P-45

###### TL-series (R)

The TL series is similar to the P-series, but it is a larger, green beam. It is also more powerful and faster manoeuvring, but it requires a lot more power, so a regular FCRT can use this for a maximum of 88 seconds worth of beam. The newest model is the TL-34.

###### Laser Hair (R)

FCRT's have no hair, but can activate short lasers sticking out of their heads,usually during battle. It can be used to ram their target, a bit like a bayonet. Some FCRT's even style it like hair, but they usually don't bother. 

###### Granite Laser (C)

The Granite Laser is a weapon designed by Computerland, but is usually used by the FCRT. Though technically not a laser, this weapon acts so much like one that it has been named The Granite Laser. It fires a beam of molten granite at the target, engulfing them. The granite solidifies as soon as it hits, immobilising the target until it is broken free.

#### Slit Bombs (U)

Slit bombs are the most common type of ammo used. They are very basic, simply a sharp projectile, reusable until they go blunt. Some are rocket powered, so they are steerable.

##### Slit bomb types

- Basic slit bombs: These are simply sharp projectiles
- Rocket-powered slit bombs: These slit bombs are rocket powered, so can steer and return to the owner after use.
- Fast-load slit bombs: These are built to be loaded quickly into the cannon, and can be lanched within a few miliseconds of one another.
- Cluster slit bombs: These are smaller slit bombs, so many can be launched at once. Therefore, many targets can be hit at once.
- Extra-small slit bombs: These are tiny slit bombs, rarley used due to their ineffectiveness. The only current users of this slit bomb are the Helucky Darkfighters.
- Deep-penetration slit bombs: These are very thin slit bombs, used to penetrate paticulary deep. They are the main slit bomb type that use eleha.
- Large-damage slit bombs: These are the opposite of deep-penetration slit bombs, broad and blunt. Due to this, a very powerful cannon is required to launch these.
- Shielded slit bombs: This slit bomb is single use, with a shield at the front that breaks off shortly before impact. They are also made of eleha.
- Surface to surface slit bombs: These are slit bombs that are purely rocket powered, launched from one planet to hit another planet. They are made of solitme.

#### Machine Guns (U)

These are incredibly small, weak projectiles, cheap but useless in space battle.

#### Tachyon Launchers (U)

    These launchers fire projectiles that harness tachyon particles. They were capable of striking targets before they have time to react, but now they are considered slow, so are now rarely used. They can be repelled by FFG's, Darkmaterial and Plasma Force Fields.

#### The Mega Flail (Ho)

The Mega Flail is a spiked ball which is attached to a ship's belly. When required, it will be launched from a ships belly and crush or spike whatever is below it. It will then be pulled back with a rope attached to it. The only army that uses this is the Horsa army.

#### Explosives

##### Hydro-bombs (R+H+F)

This is a very powerful bomb, capable of taking out a small army. When the bomb hits the surface, it implodes from the pressure. The force causes the shell to break apart, and the explosives inside explode at full force. The shock-wave of the bomb travels outward in a ripple, destroying anything in it's path. They are very expensive however, so use is limited.

###### Types of hydro-bomb

- Quick-sucsession bomb- these are meant to be fired quickly, one after the other. The first is to weaken the target, the second to destroy it and the third to destroy all remaining parts.
- Surprise bomb- this is a bomb that lets out one lethal shot, giving the enemy no chance to resist.
- Mini bomb- these are tiny bombs meant to take out a single target. These are not so good though, since the power scales cubically.

##### Rockets (R+B)

These are simply explosive slit bombs. They were popular until the Federre war, but over-use has now made them a luxury.

#### Chemicals
##### Acid thrower (R+B)

The acid thrower is an ancient weapon last used in the Horsa war. This design is simple. It acts as a water gun firing highly concentrated acid, dissolving what it touches. This weapon is now rarely used, due to the time needed for it to take effect.

#### Sound

##### Sonic Blasters (U)

Utilizing sound-wave propagation, Sonic Blasters deliver concussive blasts capable of damaging internal organs and shattering structures without traditional explosive means.
However, they have long since been forgotten as they only work on living organisms and only in an atmosphere.

#### Electromagnetic Pulse (R)

The Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) is a simple but effective piece of technology designed to incapacitate electronic systems and disrupt communication networks. It operates using electromagnetic principles and can range in scale from portable units to large-scale weapons deployed from vehicles or aircraft. The EMP is seen as a non-lethal alternative to traditional explosives, making it a strategic choice in modern warfare and electronic countermeasures.
##### EMP Types:

- Focused EMP Projector: A portable device that emits a targeted burst of electromagnetic energy, designed to disable enemy electronics in a specific area without causing physical destruction to infrastructure. Typically used by special operations units.

- Vehicle-Mounted EMP Cannon: A more powerful version designed to be mounted on military vehicles. Capable of producing a wide arc of disruption, taking out multiple electronic systems within a defined radius. Ideal for battlefield scenarios where multiple enemy vehicles and drones are present.

- Aerial EMP Drone: Small, agile drones equipped with miniaturized EMP emitters. They can fly into enemy territory and deploy a localized EMP to disrupt communications, providing a tactical advantage to ground forces. They are often used for reconnaissance missions that rely on stealth.

- Satellite-Based EMP Array: A large-scale system capable of generating a high-altitude EMP over a vast area. This system can be activated remotely to impact entire regions, knocking out grid systems, communications, and critical infrastructure with precision. It's engineered to be a deterrent against large-scale conflicts.

- Portable Microwave EMP Generator: This compact device generates focused microwave bursts capable of disrupting the electronics of nearby vehicles or drones. It can be disguised as regular equipment, allowing operatives to deploy it covertly, limiting detection and retaliation.

- Cybernetic EMP Field: A system designed to create a localized EMP field around a specific area, protecting it from electronic surveillance and attacks. Often integrated into military installations or VIP protection protocols, it can shield sensitive equipment and personnel from electronic threats.


#### Bunkers

##### Anti-bunker catapult (R+H)

The anti-bunker catapult is the most common method to destroy the bunker of the enemy. A massive weight, several km long and super dense, is launched from a catapult (also massive!) onto the bunker, but shortly before impact the entire weight is concentrated into a small area, just a few metres across, and crushes a hole into the bunker. However, the bunker usually collapses from the damage, destroying everything inside. Therefore, it can't always be used.

##### Anti-bunker drill (R+B)

The anti-bunker drill is the method Rescueland uses when they needs to capture the bunker. It drills through the ground at incredible speeds, several thousand km/h. However, it is still slower than the anti-bunker catapult, and more expensive, which is why it is not used as often. The hole it drills is 8 metres across. It can drill into the bunker from any direction, except if it is protected by Darkmaterial or FFG.
